/* NOTE: This file is for translations that are shared across multiple widgets. Specifically:
 *       1. Translations used inside shared-code (ex. in a shared component).
 *       2. Translations used in multiple widgets in order to keep the widget translation
 *          files DRY.
 *
 *       If you need to add translations that are specific to a single widget, add them to
 *       the widget's own translation file.
